Hey new dev! So excited you've joined the team. I'm headed out on PTO, see you when i get back.

while im gone, i need you to get this dashboard page over the finish line. 

Good news is, I already built everthing! 
Bad news is... I'm very disorganized. 

Just take all the files in /messyCode and reorganize them into appropriate fractal modlets, and use the scenes pattern. 

See ya!
