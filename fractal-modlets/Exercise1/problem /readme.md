This exercise does not involve writing code, but organizing files/folders.

You will start with a number of files, organized by file type.

Your job is to: 

1. Identify how many modlets are necessary 
2. Reorganize the files into proper modlet architecture. 


The files themselves have either barebones components in them, or else comments dictating what the file's content would be in real life. 
similarly, files also have comments indicating necessary imports.
