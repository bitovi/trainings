# Trainings

This repo contains the exercises for [Bitovi’s](https://www.bitovi.com) trainings.

Each folder in this repo is one training “bit” and contains all the exercises for that bit. Inside each “bit” folder are `problem` and `solution` folders (the base examples in `problem` and the completed example in `solution`).

## CodeSandbox integration

CodeSandbox’s [Synced Templates](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/sandboxes/synced-templates) allows us to dynamically create a CodeSandbox from a folder within the repo.

For example, the [`intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections/problem`](./intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections/problem) folder can be created into a CodeSandbox with this link: [`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/bitovi/trainings/tree/main/intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections/problem`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/bitovi/trainings/tree/main/intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections/problem).

## Contributing

To add an exercise, open a Pull Request that follows the [`intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections`](./intro-to-accessibility-first/semantic-sections) example.

Your exercise should include `problem` and `solution` folders. Inside the `problem` folder, be sure to include the `.codesandbox` folder to [customize how your exercise appears in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/sandboxes/synced-templates#configuring-a-title-icon--description).
