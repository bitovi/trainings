A lot can happen in a Wiki minute

2
00:02.666 --> 00:03.633
like the 60 seconds

3
00:03.633 --> 00:04.833
of everything that happens on

4
00:04.833 --> 00:06.366
Wikimedia projects.

5
00:06.366 --> 00:08.333
Or even the time it takes to answer:

6
00:08.333 --> 00:11.200
What does the Wikimedia Foundation do?

7
00:11.200 --> 00:12.500
You might know about Wikipedia,

8
00:12.500 --> 00:14.566
the free encyclopedia anyone can edit

9
00:14.566 --> 00:16.000
But you may not know that Wikipedia,

10
00:16.000 --> 00:17.900
as well as 12 other open-source projects

11
00:17.900 --> 00:19.400
dedicated to free knowledge

12
00:19.400 --> 00:21.433
are hosted and operated by a nonproﬁt,

13
00:21.666 --> 00:23.466
the Wikimedia Foundation.

14
00:23.466 --> 00:25.000
The Wikimedia Foundation is made up

15
00:25.000 --> 00:26.200
of people from around the world

16
00:26.200 --> 00:28.233
who believe knowledge is a human right.

17
00:28.233 --> 00:29.933
That’s why they work to make sure free,

18
00:29.933 --> 00:32.933
veriﬁable knowledge is accessible to everyone.

19
00:32.933 --> 00:34.066
Their work includes

20
00:34.066 --> 00:36.166
improving and maintaining world-class technology

21
00:36.166 --> 00:39.600
to support Wikimedia’s vast open-source infrastructure...

22
00:39.600 --> 00:41.800
Providing support and funding to organizations

23
00:41.800 --> 00:44.000
and people who make free knowledge possible...

24
00:44.000 --> 00:45.066
They also provide legal

25
00:45.066 --> 00:46.966
and advocacy efforts to protect people’s right

26
00:46.966 --> 00:48.933
to free knowledge around the world!

27
00:48.933 --> 00:51.100
And that’s what the Wikimedia Foundation does,

28
00:51.100 --> 00:52.900
in only a minute.
